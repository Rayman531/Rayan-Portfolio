        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focused on designing, analyzing, and manufacturing a lightweight torque wrench that intentionally fails before exceeding a 30ftlb (40Nm) threshold, protecting connected components from over-torquing. The wrench was engineered to reliably operate up to 20ftlb (27Nm) under normal use.</p>
        <p>Design constraints included fixed aluminum stock dimensions, minimal fixture changes, and limited CNC tooling options, all of which informed the final geometry and manufacturing strategy.</p>

        <div class="contribution">
            <h3>Topology Optimization</h3>
            <p> Used topology optimization methods to identify critical load paths and remove any unnecessary material while maintaining structural
                intergrity. </p>
                <p> Multiple itteratons were conducted and results were verifed through a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) staic study </p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Final weight of the wrench was 0.072 kg - an 87% reduction in mass </p>

            <h3>Static Stress Verification</h3>
            <p>Conducted multiple FEA studies to verify optimized wrench would fail within range.</p>
            <p>Four load cases were tested 112 N, 125 N, 145 N, and 166 N, these increments ensured a more accurate prediction of when and where the wrench was to fail. Loads were placed in the downwards direction at the handle to simulate the weight added, fully fixed constraints were placed at the interfaces between the nut and the wrench.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> The wrench was predicte to fail at around 125 N of force (30.1 Nm) which was before the required threshold 40Nm.</p>

            <h3>Tool Paths and Machining</h3>
            <p>The manufacturing process followed design-for-manufacturability (DFM) principles and utilized Fusion 360’s 
                Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) workspace to achieve accuracy and efficiency while staying within the project’s constraints</p>
            <p>Utilized facing and adaptive clearing and contouring operations with 1 one change of fixture</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Successfully programmed all tool paths to CNC machine the torque wrench</p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>Following the manufacturing and post processing, the wrench was tested to validate the FEA results.
        
            </p>
            <p>During physical testing, the wrench was mounted in the test rig, a steel handle was attached, and weights were incrementally applied using the hanging mass setup. Real-time torque measurements were recorded until failure occurred.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Wrench failed succesfully in the predicted location at 29.7 ft-lb which was just within acceptable range. </p>
