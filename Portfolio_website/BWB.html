        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Blended Wing Body UAV is a fourth-year Capstone project at Carleton University, focused on designing and manufacturing a solar-powered aircraft surveillance system for remote powerline surveillance and mapping.</p>
        <p>I led the design of a modular 3D-printed wing system capable of being easily assembled and disassembled. I worked closely with the Masterlines, Manufacturing, and Stress teams to ensure all design, structural, and assembly requirements were met.</p>

            <h3>Modular Wing Design</h3>
            <p>I developed a modular wing design to enable 3D-printed manufacturing and on-site assembly.</p>
            <p>I collaborated with the Stress team to analyze internal load paths and stress concentrations, then used Fusion 360 to segment each 3-foot wing into 7 structurally sound, printable sections. I also designed internal ribs and spars to ensure structural integrity and load transfer between segments.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Enabled structurally sound segmentation aligned with mechanical performance requirements.</p>

            <h3>Interlocking and Fastening Interfaces</h3>
            <p>I determined interlocking and fastening interfaces consisting of modified I-beam spar structures for modular assembly.</p>
            <p>I designed mating features and employed M3 heat-set inserts with single-sided access counterbore screws to simplify assembly and disassembly, and reduce parasitic drag. Throughout the design process i made sure to integrate design-for-manufacturability (DFM) and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) principles to ensure consistent fit and alignment of screws and interfacing parts.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Created a repeatable and field-serviceable assembly method that reduced build complexity and increased reliability of connections.</p>

            <h3>Component Validation</h3>
            <p>I validated printability and structural fit of redesigned components through half scale models and rapid prototyping.</p>
            <p>I oversaw part export and 3D printing, then led the full wing assembly process to verify alignment, tolerance stack-up, and mechanical fit. During this procecces the elevon system was also itegrated into the wing as well as fastening the wing to the fusealge.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Successfully built and tested a fully modular wing prototype, confirming elevon function and performing a taxi test.</p>
