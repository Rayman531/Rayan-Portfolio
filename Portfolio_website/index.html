        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Rayan Elia, I am a Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering graduate from Carleton University. 
            I have a strong foundation in Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), and design for manufacturing. 
            I'm passionate about complex mechanical systems and deeply enjoy the entire design process, from early-stage development, such as drafting project requirements and design inputs, to detailed design, analysis, prototyping, and final validation. </p>

        <p>What drives me most is solving real-world engineering problems that challenge me to grow and improve, both technically and personally.</p> 
        <br>   
        <p>Originally having grown up in Europe, I speak four languages and bring an international perspective that helps me connect easily with a wide range of clients and colleagues. I genuinely enjoy building relationships and bringing energy to team environments.</p>
    <br>
        <p>During my internships at AGF and Phadisco—two respected medical device companies in Cyprus—I developed hands-on experience in troubleshooting and diagnostics for complex systems. 
        These roles strengthened my understanding of key industry regulations and standards related to medical device quality, installation, validation, and commissioning. 
        They also reinforced the importance of attention to detail when working with life-critical systems and gave me valuable insight into how engineering intersects with healthcare outcomes </p>
