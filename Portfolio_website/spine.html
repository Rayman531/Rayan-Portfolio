        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this project was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the mechanical stability provided by spinal fixation hardware in a porcine cervical spine model. 
            The experiment simulated three clinical conditions: a healthy spine, an injured spine (disc disruption), and a post-fixation spine using pedicle screws and a cross-rod system. 
            The goal was to analyze how spinal motion changes across these conditions under flexion-extension and lateral bending loads. </p>

            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>The specimen was prepared by removing soft tissue while preserving ligamentous structures. Rigid body marker pins were then inserted into three vertebrae to enable motion tracking using an Optotrak motion capture system. </p>
                <p>The spine was mounted on a test fixture equipped with a six-axis load cell and actuated by a torsion arm.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
            <p>Motion data was collected simultaneously with internal loading data using LabVIEW and NDI First Principles software, synchronized electronically at a 100 Hz sampling rate over a 30-second test duration.</p>
            <p>Using MATLAB, a pipeline was implemented to process raw marker coordinates into local vertebral coordinate systems. 
                Transformation matrices were calculated as well as relative rotation angles of the vertebrae under load. This was done for each of the three states—healthy, injured, and fixated—under both flexion-extension and lateral bending.</p>
           <p> Two key metrics were extracted from this data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Range of Motion (ROM): Maximum angular displacement experienced by the top vertebra relative to the bottom.</li>
                <li>Neutral Zone (NZ): Region around the neutral posture where minimal resistance to motion occurs, often associated with spinal instability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Hysteresis plots were generated to visualize angular deformation versus applied moment, and bar plots were used to compare NZ and ROM across conditions.</p>
            <p> These analyses offered biomechanical insight into how spinal stabilization hardware reduces motion and helps restore structural integrity after injury.</p>
            <p> The hysteresis plots for the healthy, injured and fixated case are presented bellow for the flexion-extension movements </p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>In the flexion-extension tests, the healthy spine showed moderate angular motion with a stable hysteresis response and balanced ROM and NZ values. 
                After injury, both the hysteresis curve and bar charts revealed increased angular deformation and a wider neutral zone, indicating reduced structural stability. 
                Once fixation hardware was applied, the spine exhibited a much stiffer response, with narrower hysteresis loops and reduced ROM and NZ values, demonstrating that the fixation successfully limited motion and restored mechanical stability.</p>
