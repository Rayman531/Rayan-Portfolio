        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this project was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the mechanical stability provided by spinal fixation hardware in a porcine cervical spine model. 
            The experiment simulated three clinical conditions: a healthy spine, an injured spine (disc disruption), and a post-fixation spine using pedicle screws and a cross-rod system. 
            The goal was to analyze how spinal motion changes across these conditions under flexion-extension and lateral bending loads. </p>
